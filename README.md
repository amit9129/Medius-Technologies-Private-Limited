In this Django file upload assignment, I developed a robust file upload feature that allows users to upload files securely to the server. The project structure includes a Django application with models, views, and templates to handle file uploads. I began by creating a `FileUpload` model to store uploaded files and their metadata, including the file name and upload timestamp. The form for file uploads was implemented using Django's built-in forms, ensuring validation for file types and sizes. In the views, I implemented logic to handle both GET and POST requests: for GET requests, a blank form is presented, while for POST requests, the uploaded file is processed and saved to the server. The response includes feedback on the upload status, informing the user whether the upload was successful or if any errors occurred. Additionally, I configured media file settings to manage the storage location and serve the files correctly. The templates were designed to provide a user-friendly interface, facilitating an intuitive file upload experience. Overall, this assignment emphasizes security measures, proper data handling, and a seamless user experience in file management within a Django application.
